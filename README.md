This project is a vintage-horror inspired game. It is a new atmospheric take on the old-fashioned rock paper scissors game. To play this game, you can download the executable from my itch page.

To run this game, simply download the zip file, and extract the folder anywhere you wish.
Inside the extracted folder should be a bunch of .py files, and the executable. 
Just make sure all these files are in the same folder and the executable should work.

Have fun!!
